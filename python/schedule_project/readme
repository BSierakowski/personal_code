Process and Resource Manager

To run the process manager, simply type "python shell.py" in a command shell.

The process manager implements these functions (all arguments are required):

ps                   list all processes and resources, and information about 
                      them
cr [name] [priority] create a process with a given name and priority
kill [name/pid]      destroy a process with a given name or process id
req [rid]            request a resource with a given resource id
rel [rid]            release the resource with the given resource id
susp [name/pid]      suspend a process with a given name or process id
act [name/pid]       activate a process with a given name or process id
time                 simulate an IO timeout
req_io               request the IO resource
rel_io               release the IO resource

The files contained in this project are:
shell.py:       The interactive shell
scheduler.py:   The scheduler and all the functions listed above
process.py:     Process control block, resource control block, and priority
                queue definitions

I don't understand how to demonstrate a deadlock situation.
