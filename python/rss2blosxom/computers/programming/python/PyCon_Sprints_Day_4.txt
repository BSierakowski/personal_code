PyCon Sprints Day 4
<p>
The two groups have finished their parcels to the level where we can show them as part of our presentation on Thursday.   I think this is great - It helps a bit with the presentation nerves as well.

Other happenings at the sprints:

PJE and Bob Ippolito have been hard at work on <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs">PythonEggs</a>.   This is going to be really good for Python -- it should make delivering applications of all kinds (including Chandler) much easier.

<br />Best quote of the day: "You know what?  I'll eat the microseconds."

Donovan Preston showed me his  LivePage Test framework yesterday, and I forgot to mention it.  Donovan is one of those folks who was doing AJAX stuff before the current AJAX hype got started.   The stuff that I saw looked really useful for people who want to try to build richer in browser applications.
