Organic or Mechanic?
<p>
Like personality sorters?  Try this <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2005/02/20/organics_and_mechanics.html">article</a> from Rands in Repose.  I don't think I had seen the Organic/Mechanic distinction before.   It also links to another <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/08/05/incrementalists_completionists.html">article</a> on Incrementalists and Completionists, which I think is kind of related to Shirky's <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2005/03/09/one_world_two_maps_thoughts_on_the_wikipedia_debate.php">Radial vs Cartesian</a>.
