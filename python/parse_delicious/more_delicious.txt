Find Unique Del.icio.us Posts
I frequently find that I use del.icio.us tags as a means to browse all
bookmarks with a certain tag. Unfortunately, the "link of the moment" often
overwhelms the rest of the links, making the category hard to browse.
Furthermore, I want to browse every link with the given tag, not just the
popular ones, so the popular section won't work.<p>
For example, today I bought a new 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/">iPod photo</a>, so I wanted to see
what python hacks there are for working with the iPod. I went to <a
href="http://del.icio.us/tag/python+ipod">http://del.icio.us/tag/python+ipod</a>,
but as you can see, it's cluttered with repeat links. Naturally, to fix it, I
thought I'd hack something up.<p>
<h2>The Script</h2><p>
A problem on del.icio.us is that there are no RSS feeds available for the
tag pages. Fortunately, I had already written a function to screenscrape 
del.icio.us pages. Given an open del.icio.us file handle, it scrapes the links 
and all relevant information from the page.<p>
Given that function, it was pretty easy to get what I wanted. Since I can only
scrape one page per second per the API docs, it's slow, but it's not too often
that I want to use it, so it's not bad.<p>
I wrote a quick CGI wrapper for the whole thing so that I could use it, but it
would be trivial to make it output information on the command line or within
another python program. If you're interested in the code, it's available <a
href="http://llimllib.f2o.org/files/delparse.py">here</a>. gen_tag(...) is the
function most likely to be of use to somebody; it's a generator which scrapes 
a del.icio.us page and yields individual posts.
It doesn't handle utf-8 right now, but it does otherwise work
on every del.icio.us page I've tried it on; if you improve it, please <a
href="mailto:llimllib@f2o.org">drop me a line</a>.
You can see an example output of the cgi script <a 
href="http://llimllib.f2o.org/del_uniq/unique.html">right here</a>.<p>
<h2>Footnote</h2><p>
While I've got everyone's attention (hah!), does anybody have a del.icio.us data
dump that I could play with? I'd be willing to pay for the transportation of a
CD plus interest. I have a half-a%$ed script to pull the data, but I don't feel
like sucking all that bandwidth. Have your people email <a 
href="mailto:llimllib@f2o.org">my people</a> if you can help me out.
