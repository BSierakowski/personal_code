* This natural inequality of the two powers of population and of production in 
  the earth, and that great law of our nature which must constantly keep their
  effects equal, form the great difficulty that to me appears insurmountable in
  the way to the perfectibility of society. All other arguments are of slight and
  subordinate consideration in comparison of this... No
  fancied equality, no agrarian regulations in their utmost extent, could remove
  the pressure of it even for a single century. And it appears, therefore, to be
  decisive against the possible existence of a society, all the members of which
  should live in ease, happiness, and comparative leisure; and feel no anxiety
  about providing the means of subsistence for themselves and families.

* For I conceive that it may be laid down as a position not to be controverted,
  that, taking a sufficient extent of territory to include within it exportation
  and importation, and allowing some variation for the prevalence of luxury, or
  of frugal habits, that population constantly bears a regular proportion to the
  food that the earth is made to produce. 

* I think I may fairly make two postulata.

First, That food is necessary to the existence of man.

Secondly, That the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state.
