* The setup: Godwin vs. Malthus
    * Malthus was an author, economist and reverend
    * Godwin was the inventor of Anarchy, an iconoclast
    * Godwin believed that Man was infintely perfectible
    * Malthus thought this was silly, and he had a simple argument for why
* The Big Idea
    * Malthus' two principles: 1) people gonna fuck and 2) people need to eat
    * Food Growth is linear
    * Human Growth is exponential
    * Therefore, human growth cannot outstrip food growth and humanity will grow
      until it reaches its food limit
* Why The Big Idea Failed
    * evidence it failed (graph of population slightly before, and since Malthus)
    * It hasn't *fundamentally* failed, but technology took such huge leaps
      that food has been plentiful
        * mention green revolution?
* Relate it to Today
    * we're now (or soon) going to be constrained by energy, not food
        * energy as a more basic attribute than food
    * Malthus' two principles still apply
        * and apply with a vengeance. Humanity will not go backwards willingly!
            *expand further on this point?
    * We're at a dangerous point, where we may have become dependant on technology growth
        * can we reach an equilibrium from here?
    * maybe show graph with a line showing the equilibrium without mass energy, and a question mark above our
      current population asking where it is with free energy?
* What we can do about it
    * Work on more efficient energy
    * Colonize a planet
    * Thought: those selling doom from global warming are similar to those selling doom via Malthus?
        * would have to set up earlier with a mention that people have sold doom via Malthus. Maybe an example
