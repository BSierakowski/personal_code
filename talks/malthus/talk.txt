* The setup: Godwin vs. Malthus
    * The year was 1798
        The French Revolution was coming to a close, and the American
        Revolution had ended just 15 years ago. John Locke, David Hume, and Adam
        Smith had just rewritten the whole of political philosophy. To some, it
        seemed that
        humanity was on the verge of a breakthrough. One of those was William
        Godwin.
    * on Godwin
        An iconoclast, one of the founders of anarchism, and a
        believer in the infinite perfectability of mankind, Godwin believed
        that each generation was improving upon the last, and
        he saw no reason why this trend would not continue indefinitely.
    * Malthus (:30)
        Opposing this view was the reverent Thomas Robert Malthus.
        One of the greatest economists
        of all time, his name suffered the worst fate that history has to offer:
        it was turned into an adjective. Before I explain what it means,
        let's talk about what he wrote in 1798
* The Big Idea
    * The two principles
        Malthus starts with two simple principles: People need food, and people
        are going to keep having sex (and babies).

        But there's a problem: each person can have 2 babies, but every square
        acre of farm can only produce a given quantity of food. That means that
        people can grow exponentially, while food can only grow linearly.
    * linear vs. exponential. Doom! (1:00)
        Here's the graph that everybody thinks Malthus was talking about.
        Population grows out of control, while food grows slowly. The inevitable
        result is *doom*!!?!

        But that's not what Malthus actually claimed. Instead, he argued that
        population is *limited* by the availability of food.
    * But he really meant...
        Therefore, population grows in proportion to the available food, and
        usually to the limit of the available food. Because we are usually at
        the limit of the available food, he argues that Godwin was wrong,
        humanity is not perfectible, and there will always be misery in the
        world because *somebody* will be at the margin without food.
* What does that say about population now
* Relate it to Today
    * we're now (or soon) going to be constrained by energy, not food
        * energy as a more basic attribute than food
    * Malthus' two principles still apply
        * and apply with a vengeance. Humanity will not go backwards willingly!
            *expand further on this point?
    * We're at a dangerous point, where we may have become dependant on technology growth
        * can we reach an equilibrium from here?
    * maybe show graph with a line showing the equilibrium without mass energy, and a question mark above our
      current population asking where it is with free energy?
* What we can do about it
    * Work on more efficient energy
    * Colonize a planet
    * Thought: those selling doom from global warming are similar to those selling doom via Malthus?
        * would have to set up earlier with a mention that people have sold doom via Malthus. Maybe an example
