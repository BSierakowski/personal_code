What I want to do is study the application of computer science techniques to
economic and other human problems.

What I want to do is to study the thory of computer science at the border
between human and machine interaction.

I would like to study the theory of computer science at the point where it
meets human endevour. I am fascinated by theoretical results like Braess'
paradox which have something to say about how we organize ourselves.

(Question: should I not mention the applicability of algorithms to human
endeavor? Many think that the theory should be studied for its own sake.)

We live in a world full of markets populated by both human and robot
participants. The algorithmic complexities of this world are just beginning to
be mapped out, and are developing along with the markets.

The market as an emergent phenomenon 

At the border of computer science, game theory, and economics, a whole range of
questions are just beginning to be asked for which there is no clear answer.
There are many areas where the questions haven't even been asked yet. 

I would like to study problems at the border of computer science, game theory,
and economics. I've wanted to continue to do computer science research since I
left college, but I didn't find my research topic until I was working for a
bookseller writing pricing robots that arbitraged the different prices between
books on several different online markets.
