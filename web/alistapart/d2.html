<h1>Here Be Dragons: Mapping the Limits of Web Applications</h1>
<p>During the Great Web Standards Stagnation of 2000-2007, web applications
seemed as dead as they could get. Javascript and DOM were good for cute tricks

ActiveX was busily opening up new holes in Windows every week, Java applets
sucked in the same ways they've always sucked, and flash was used for that damn
introductory page on every commercial web site.</p>
