<h1>Here Be Dragons: Mapping the Limits of Web Applications</h1>

<p>During the
Great Web Standards Stagnation of 2000-2007, web applications seemed as dead as
they could get. Javascript and DOM were good for cute tricks like making
letters follow your mouse, but not capable of any real work. ActiveX was busy
opening up new security holes in Windows every week, Java applets sucked in the
same ways they've always sucked, and flash was used for that damn introductory
page on every commercial web site. HTML had no new features, and no prospect of
gaining any.</p>
<!-- is 2007 really an OK date to use? What was happening in 2006? -->

<p>Eventually, though, something had to give. <em>Everyone</em> was on the web,
and people were finally making money again. Despite the best efforts of the SVG
and XHTML groups facing a dead yet dominant browser in Internet Explorer 6,
nothing seemed to be happening.</p>

<p>The undercurrent of frustration finally
broke through in a couple of places. Google legitimized XMLHttpRequest, a
nonstandard Microsoft creation, by using it in their search engine. Apple
created the &lt;canvas&gt; tag to enable web developers to write dashboard
widgets, and the WHATWG gathered steam by picking it up and specifying it.</p>
<!--fact check-->

<p>When Google and the WHATWG began planning for a
standard to succeed HTML 4 and replace the largely failed XHTML spec, the walls
began to crumble. For the past year and a half, the web has seen a staggering
increase in the capabilities available to web application developers. The HTML
5 standard, backed by Google, is specifying a real programming environment
using javascript and DOM. Concurrently, Flash has gone semi-open, gained
desktop integration, and brought 3d and video to the web. ActiveX is dead, and
Microsoft reinvented it in a more secure and semi-cross-platform manner. Java
applets, however, still suck.</p>
<!-- is it fair not to mention JavaFX? It's insignificant ISTM, and applets are
     still supported, right? I'm not mentioning google native code either -->

<p>Faced with a bevy of alternative programming environments, a rapidly
evolving HTML spec supported differently by every version of every browser, and
people <em>still</em> using IE6, it's no longer easy to say what is possible
with web applications and what is not. In the spirit of Hilbert's unanaswered
questions of mathematics <!-- better name? link? -->, this article will attempt
to sketch a few of the limits of what is possible to distribute to a large
majority of internet users, and discuss some of the issues around those
limits.</p>

<h2>Cross-domain Communication</h2>

<p>Should Facebook be allowed to communicate with Flickr via your browser, with
your credentials?  Of course not - that leads to all kinds of security
problems, like cross-site scripting attacks. What if spammers hacked Flickr and
used an XSS attack to friend themselves to everyone?<p>

<p>On the other hand, it is pretty neat that I can piggyback off google's copy
of jquery. Or put disqus comments on my blog without worrying about installing
anything to my server. Or put any one of a million "badges" on my website that
display live data about me or my friends off my favorite websites.</p>

<p>The browser has a serious schizophrenia about websites telling the client to pull
data from other sites; it's allowed if it's the source of an iframe, image, css
or javascript file, but it's not
