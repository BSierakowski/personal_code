<h1>Here Be Dragons: Mapping the Limits of Web Applications</h1>
<p>During the Great Web Standards Stagnation of 2000-2007, web applications
seemed as dead as they could get. Javascript and DOM were good for cute tricks
like making letters follow your mouse, but not capable of any real work.
ActiveX was busily opening up new holes in Windows every week, Java applets
sucked in the same ways they've always sucked, and flash was used for that damn
introductory page on every commercial web site. HTML had no new features, and
no prospect of gaining any.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, something had to give. <em>Everyone</em> was on the web,
and people were finally making money again. Despite the best efforts of the SVG
and XHTML groups facing a dead yet dominant browser in Internet Explorer,
nothing seemed to be happening.</p>
<p>The undercurrent of frustration
finally broke through in a couple of places. Google legitimized XMLHttpRequest, a
nonstandard Microsoft creation, by using it in their search engine. Apple created the &lt;canvas&gt;
tag to enable web developers to write dashboard widgets, and the WHATWG
gathered steam by picking it up and specifying it. <!--fact check--></p>
<p>When the WHATWG and Google began pushing for a standard to succeed HTML 4
and replace the largely failed XHTML spec, the walls began to crumble. For the
past year and a half, the web has seen a staggering increase in the
capabilities available to web application developers. The HTML 5 standard,
backed by Google, is specifying a real programming environment using javascript
and DOM. Flash has gone semi-open, gained desktop integration, and brought 3d
and video to the web. ActiveX is dead, and Microsoft reinvented it in a more
secure and semi-cross-platform manner. Java applets, however, still suck.</p>
<!-- is it fair not to mention JavaFX? It's insignificant ISTM, and applets are
     still, supported, right? -->
<p>Faced with a bevy of alternative programming environments, a rapidly
evolving HTML spec supported differently by every browser and
