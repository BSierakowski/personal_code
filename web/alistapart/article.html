<h1>Here Be Dragons: Mapping the Limits of Web Applications</h1>
<p>The standards which define the web have grown organically over the past 17 
years from a simple hypertext system for sharing scientific documents to a 
tangled web of technologies for specifying the display and behavior of
increasingly complicated applications. Accordingly, they have accumulated 
powers and limits on those powers in an uneven, haphazard way.</p>
<p>These uneven limits pose a problem to web developers; when have an idea for 
an application, we're often unsure of even its basic possibility with open 
standards. Many of these limitations have workarounds, often quite baroque, 
that let us do what we want at the cost of infuriating complexity.</p>
<p>After the Great Web Standards Stagnation of 2000-2007, a new era of browser 
competition and the arrival of HTML 5 have finally begun to introduce new 
capabilities for web developers, so it's worth surveying what can and cannot 
now be done with pure Javascript and DOM in the browser.</p>
<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p>Storing data locally on a user's computer has been handled up to now by one 
official mechanism, HTTP cookies, and a host of other hacks. Each mechanism has 
major drawbacks, including but not limited to security leaks, small amounts of 
storage, inefficient bandwidth use, and excessive server load.</p>
<p>HTML 5 promises to do away with these hacks, offering simple, standard, 
local data storage in a couple of flavors. <var>localStorage</var> offers 
persistent data per website, and <var>
<p>Surprisingly, <a

Explorer</a> is among those leading the way in support for HTML 5 storage, with 
IE 8 beta 2 supporting both methods proposed in the spec. Webkit nightlies do 
too, although neither Safari nor Chrome does. Firefox 3 supports an older 
version of the spec.
