<h1>Here Be Dragons: Mapping the Limits of Web Applications</h1>
<p>The standards which define the web have grown organically over the past 17 
years from a simple hypertext system for sharing scientific documents to a 
tangled web of technologies for specifying the display and behavior of
increasingly complicated applications. Accordingly, they have accumulated 
powers and limits on those powers in an uneven, haphazard way.</p>
<p>These uneven limits pose a problem to web developers; when have an idea for 
an application, we're often unsure of even its basic possibility with open 
standards. Many of these limitations have workarounds, often quite baroque, 
that let us do what we want at the cost of infuriating complexity.</p>
<p>After the Great Web Standards Stagnation of 2000-2007, a new era of browser 
competition and the arrival of HTML 5 have finally begun to introduce new 
capabilities for web developers.
