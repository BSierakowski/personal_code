The Digital Image Part 1: The Histogram

<p>As I have recently taken up <a 
href="http://flickr.com/user/llimllib">photography</a>, I've been using Adobe 
Lightroom to manage and manipulate my photographs. While I've learned some 
things about how to manipulate its settings to make my photographs better, I 
realized that I don't understand in a deep way how manipulation of digital 
photographs works.
<p>As such, I present here part 1 of a series examining in detail the analysis 
and manipulation of digital photographs. In it, we'll look at how an image can 
be thought of as a matrix of pixels, is represented as an array in javascript, 
what a histogram is, and we'll build a javscript function
