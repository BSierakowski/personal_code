The Digital Image Part 1: The Histogram
#kewyrods KJ

<p>As I have recently taken up <a 
href="http://flickr.com/user/llimllib">photography</a>, I've been using Adobe 
Lightroom to manage and manipulate my photographs. While I've learned some 
things about how to manipulate its settings to make my photographs better, I 
realized that I don't understand in a deep way how manipulation of digital 
photographs works.
<p>As such, I present here part 1 of a series examining in detail the analysis 
and manipulation of digital photographs. In it, we'll look at how an image can 
be thought of as a matrix of pixels, is represented as an array in javascript, 
what a histogram is, and we'll look at how to build a couple histograms.

<p><h2>Waitâ€¦ Javascript?</h2>
<p>You read that right, we'll be using javascript for this project. Thanks to
Jacob Seidelin's <a href="http://www.pixastic.com/">Pixastic</a> library, all 
the heavy lifting and DOM manipulation is taken care of for us, and I can write 
some demos that will work, live, in your browser<sup><a 
href="#foot1">1</a></sup>.
<p>Although it may be helpful to understand javascript to get the most out of 
this article, nearly all of it should be readable without any prior knowledge.

<p><h2>The Image</h2>
<p>The most intuitive, simple way to think of a digital image is as a table of 
pixels. Each pixel has a color, and displaying the image is as simple as 
putting the table up on the screen in proper sequence.
