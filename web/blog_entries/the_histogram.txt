Image Porgramming in Javascript: The Histogram
#time
<p>Recently, I've spent a lot of my time <a 
href="http://flickr.com/photos/llimllib">taking photographs</a>. When I get 
home from taking pictures, I immediately pop open Lightroom to import the 
images, pick out my favorites, and publish them.
<p>As a programmer, though, it was bothering me that I don't know 
<em>exactly</em> what's happening behind the scenes with my images. What's 
<em>really</em> happening when I adjust the "saturation" slider for a photo?  
How does sharpening work, and what does its "amount" mean?
<p>Sure, I could go read books to find out, but there's only way to really know 
what's happening: write a program to do it. This article represents part 1 of 
what will hopefully become a series on programming the digital image with 
javascript.
<h2>Wait, Javascript?</h2>
<p>Sure thing! With the recent adoption of the &lt;canvas&gt; element into 
modern browsers, javascript now has the capability to load, display, and 
manipulate images at the pixel level.
