Mission statement: Our goal is to produce programmers with the skills to excel 
 in a large-company environment, startup company environment, or academic 
 environment. We want our programmers to be familiar with the latest tools and 
 software development techniques. Our school will rigorously uphold the values 
 of proper ethics, critical though, and openness in both mind and code.

<ul>No two people learn the same way, or at the same pace. Provide all possible
tools for them to succeed.
<ul>All code is open and in source control

<ul>If it's not tested, it doesn't work
<ul>Practice is essential; Programmers need to program
<ul>Theory is important; Work should not be wasted

<h2>The Virtues</h2><p>
<ul>Openness
<ul>Flexibility
<ul>Language Independence
<ul>Building On Others' Work
<ul>Critical Reading
<ul>Code Reading
<ul>Hard Work
