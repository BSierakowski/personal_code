TODO: intro

What I'd like to propose is a design for a school intended for the other half 
of the spectrum, the hackers.

A quick note on terminology: I will henceforth refer to traditional university 
computer science classes as "college" and to my hypothetical new school as "the 
school".

<h2>The Axioms</h2><br>

<h3>Flexibility</h3><br>
Not every student learns at the same pace. In college, each course moves at one 
pace, regardless of the capability of any particular student.

<h3>Openness</h3><br>
<h3>Students First</h3><br>
