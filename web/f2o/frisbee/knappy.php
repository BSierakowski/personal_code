Summer League Mid-Season Update<br><br>

<p>Ah, the Vox Populi. She's a cruel and demanding little vixen. It's easy to write that first update: you can claim any team is going to win and who's going to remember in late August anyway? And then the voice of the people rises up and starts clamoring for more. MORE unsubstantiated rumors, MORE scurrilous innuendo, MORE hollow predictions, and MORE half-baked scouting reports based upon nothing other than wild guesses and some beer-addled Roshambo against myself. Sure, some of those teams from the first update came through for me. Meanwhile, a few under-achievers are making me look less like Nostradamas and more like Miss Cleo. And y'all know who you are.</p>

<p>As of tonight, there are only three undefeated teams remaining out of a sweet 64. You have to give Steve, Brian and their minions some mad props for creating a league with tremendous parity. One of the great equalizers this year has been the smaller rosters, creating a situation when even a great team can be caught shorthanded and lose to a team that they probably shouldn't. One team that has avoided this pitfall so far comes as no surprise to veteran PADA players: Brendan & Nancy's team at 7-0 and the Kings (yes, Nancy, and Queens) of Kazahkstan. As mentioned briefly in the preview, this team was auto-drafted, which means that neither captain was at the draft to pick their own players. Well, karma paid them back in a big way because they have won all 7 of their games by the scores of 15-10, 15-11 or 15-12. No blowouts and no squeakers, it would seem just the Smith clan coming through in the clutch as usual.</p>

<p>The other two undefeated teams that are left come as more of a surprise: Mike & Liz's Orange Crush and our team, Team Funnel. I had the opportunity to watch Mike's team for a few minutes one weekend afternoon as they dismantled Clayton & Heather's solid squad, 15-7. As Brian Canniff said on the PADA message board, they are \"the real deal\". On another night when thunderstorms cut short every game, and no other team scored more than 11 points before the rain ended the scoring, Orange Crush took their game 15-5. Unless this one was a re-scheduled game, that's a bit scary (unsubstantiated rumor, as promised.) Their biggest win so far came in a 15-13 battle against Dr. Pull & Kimberly's previously undefeated team. There's no doubt that they relied heavily on legendary handler Jon Epstein (one summer when we were on the same team, Jon threw a behind-the-back pass to me for a goal) and UPenn speedster Matt Schmucker.</p>

<p>As an aside, a draft guru who sat next to me on draft night had the top 150 men available ranked in order. He had Matt Schmucker, if I remember correctly, listed in the top five or six. (For comparison's sake, he didn't know I was going to captain & had me ranked at #111. Bastard!) Mike & Liz, rookie drafters and ridiculously nice people, were helped by good spirit (read: Clayton) and got him at pick #32. Since we mentioned Dr. Pull & Kimberly, their team also had another incredible game two days before that when they handed the Joe Ford Experiment their only loss in a 17-16 friendly feud. As for Team Funnel, standing atop Thailand at 6-0, journalistic integrity prevents me from blathering on about how lucky we got with our roster. The aforementioned draft guru did me an incredible favor when he told me to pick Pike's Chris K in the first round. The team's big wins so far came against Just Head (Cutts/Plummer) and the spirited Wawa Unblowupables (TC & Liz.)</p>

Other teams making some noise include:<br><br>
ROMANIA Everyone knows about the Red Neck Truckers (George/Lienert), Hite's Avengers (Minecci/Montalvo) and Trey & LT, but Brad Moser's team has exceptional women plus Nacho & the talented Mike Jarvis. They're tied at 4-1 with Delcollo & Furr, featuring the ambidextrous throws of first round pick Brian Cleary. Still, my money is now on Minecci & Trey to fight it out for the division lead.<br><br>
SPAIN Look out for Christian's yellow clad Bili Rubin team to compete with preseason picks Mutiny (Kudera/Kurtz), Freshly Squeezed (Panna/Trommelen) and Curtis & Vicki. They have vets like Chris O'Connor, Larry Schwartz, & Johnny Mac teamed up with Susan McPhedran, Patty Min and a cadre of ladies that Christian describes as \"awesome\". I have not seen or heard reports about Waslin & Dooley, but they must be VERY good as they've beaten Viner & Speirs, Freshly Squeezed, & Brad X and Tracy Berg's team. Three big wins if Was can stay healthy, look for this team to compete with Curtis & Vicki for the division title. This division is as tough as it gets, with 5 different teams holding winning records — more than any other division so far. And one team with 4 losses, Colly & Bonnie's, had the unfortunate displeasure of losing close games to Curtis & Vicki, Minecci & Montalvo, Mullen & Line AND Waslin & Dooley. Talk about a tough schedule how would you like to have those first two be your out-of-division games?<br><br>
MONACO I'm sticking with my pre-season picks here with Mullen & Laura Line fighting it out with the wily Dillon & Pfeiffer, although the latter team was upset this week by Brian Girard & Natalie Terry's team, 16-15.<br><br>
NETHERLANDS People have chastised me for not mentioning Jay Soda & Sam Wittchen's team in the preview. They have scored two big wins so far over division rival Mojo (the equally stacked combo of Kareem & co-cap Johnson) and Minecci/Montalvo. Both games were squeakers, but I'm willing to admit that they're sounding real strong. Mojo scored a big win by beating El Presidente's loaded squad, so they must be for real, too. But, will all these old folks be able to run with Nuprin & Princess layout (Sarah)?<br><br>
JAPAN See the above spiel on Orange Crush/Dr.Pull/JFXperiment.<br><br>
KAZAKHSTAN Dan Heckman's still nursing a sprained ankle, so my preseason fav has had a tough time with it. Obviously, the main story here has been the Smiths, running away with it so far. Never ever underestimate Big Rick's team, though.<br><br>
THAILAND A contender for the league's most unlucky team so far might be the Rubber Duckies, who lost their captain for the season to a gruesome broken leg one game after a fast college handler suffered a very bloody broken nose. Steve & Penny have had a lot of rainouts so it's up in the air as to whether or not they can repeat last year's glory. Attendance problems have plagued Sackett & Schein so far. This division may produce a dark horse late in the season, but right now it looks to be a two team race (see above.) VIETNAM I basically mentioned every team in this division in the pre-season update, so I basically look like a genius no matter who is in first place. No surprise though that my #1 pick, Just Head (Cutts/Plummer), is in the division lead after a big win over the previously undefeated college all star team that is captained by Fisher & Chen. A team that has been strongly touted on the PADA message board is Len & Amy's team, who are 3-1 (with their only loss by a score of 14-15.) And that's without Len playing, so they might be a force to reckon with in the playoffs.<br><br>
