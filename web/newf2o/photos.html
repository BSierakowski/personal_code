        You'll have to content yourself with what's on the headers for now,
        since I don't yet know exactly how I want to display them. Rest assured
        that the customer is priority #1 at Bill Mill enterprises, so the
        pictures my public demands will return!<p><p>
        And, since Scott's bought me a beer more than once, I'll link to his <a 
        href="http://www.loonrentals.com/ni138/default.htm">condo at Loon Mountain<a>.
        Heading to New Hampshire to ski? Rent his badass condo. I hope he loans
        it to me for putting this up on my site.
