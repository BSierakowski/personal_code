<p>If you've been surfing the web for any amount of time, you probably have a 
few sites that you visit every day. More than likely, many of these sites all 
have one feature in common - a place for users to log in and customize the 
website for themselves. If you've decided to start a webpage offering content to 
users, chances are you've wanted to add a login script to your own site. With 
this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of PHP authentication.</p>

<p>Once you've decided to let your users log in, you'll need a few things. 
You'll need a web server (preferably <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>) 
with a working installation of PHP
. Also, you'll need a <a href="http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL</a> 
database and the 
permissions on it to create and drop databases. All of these products, might I 
add, are open source, and all of them are available for a grand total of $0 
(unless you want to run MySQL on Windows for more than 30 days - read their 
website for details).</p>

<p>To understand this tutorial, the only thing you'll need is a very basic 
understanding of HTML, 
databases, and PHP. There are good tutorials on these all 
over the web, so I'll let you cover them by yourself.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll need to get started is a place to store the users that 
you'll create. If you fire up the command interpereter for MySQL, you can start 
with a couple statements:</p>

<textarea cols="50" rows="10">mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE dictators;
mysql&gt; use dictators;
mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE users (
    -&gt; user_name varchar(15) NOT NULL,
    -&gt; password varchar(32) NOT NULL,
    -&gt; PRIMARY KEY (user_name));</textarea>

<p>What you did first was create a database "dictators" which will hold the user 
information for our fictional company - Dictators Inc. Secondly, you told MySQL 
that you wanted it to use that database, then you created a table in it with 2 
fields, one for the user_name and one for the password. The username field can 
be any amount of characters up to 15, and the password field up to 32. Although 
we will only keep this information in the "dictators" database, it could contain 
any number of tables and just about any amount of data. 
Speaking of data, let's add some to the users table so that we can test what we've created:</p>

<textarea cols="50" rows="10">mysql&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES('pol_pot', 'evilevil');</textarea>

<p>With this statement, you added the user 'pol_pot', with the password 'evilevil'. 
The MySQL syntax for this statement is somewhat forgiving - the capitals are a 
usual way of denoting <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> 
language statements, and you can use single or double 
quotes. Either way, you now have a user in the database that you can try to log 
in. To get them to log in, we'll need a simple HTML form to capture his username 
and password:</p>

<textarea cols="50" rows="10">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;login.html&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form name="login" method="post" action="validate.php"&gt;
username:&lt;input type="text" name="user_name"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
password:&lt;input type="password" name="password"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</textarea>

<p>It's better to use method="post" here, because you don't want the user to be 
able to bookmark the page where he's logged in. If you choose to use 
method="get" to pass these variables to the validate.php, the variables will be 
put into the actual address of the page (i.e. 
"http://example.com/validate.php?username=pol_pot&amp;password=evilevil"). This 
would allow the user to go back to the validate page without actually logging in 
again, which is a rather large security hole. Therefore, we use "post" to send 
the variables through the browser. Now that we've sent the user_name and 
password, how do we recover them? Here comes the beauty of PHP for the web:</p>

<textarea cols="50" rows="10">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;validate.php&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;?php
	$user_name = $_POST['user_name'];
	$password = $_POST['password'];
?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</textarea>

<p>Form variables sent through "post" end up in the <span>$_POST</span> array (in newer versions 
of PHP, anyway). To pull them out, we simply reference this array using the 
"name" attribute of the form as a key in the array.</p>

<p>Now that we've got the variables into PHP, we're ready for some first real 
validation; we'll compare the variables that we sent to validate.php against 
those we stored in the database. To do that, all we have to do is connect to the 
MySQL database through PHP, then try to retrieve any database entries with the 
same user_name and password that the user entered. If there is one and only one 
entry, then we can say that the user is verified. We'll add code to the already 
existing validate.php to accomplish this:</p>

<textarea cols="50" rows="10">&lt;?php
	session_start();
	$db_user = 'mysql_username';
	$db_pass = 'mysql_password';
	$user_name = $_POST['user_name'];
	$password = $_POST['password'];

	//connect to the DB and select the "dictator" database
	$connection = mysql_connect('localhost', $db_user, $db_pass) or die(mysql_error());
	mysql_select_db('dictators', $connection) or die(mysql_error());

	//set up the query
	$query = "SELECT * FROM users 
			WHERE user_name='$user_name' AND password='$password'";
			
	//run the query and get the number of affected rows
	$result = mysql_query($query, $connection) or die('error making query');
	$affected_rows = mysql_num_rows($result);

	//if there's exactly one result, the user is validated. Otherwise, he's invalid
	if($affected_rows == 1) {
		print 'validated';
	}
	else {
		print 'not valid';
	}
?&gt;</textarea>

<p>At this point, you can redirect the user to a receipt page, but you still have a 
problem - if the user wants to go anywhere else on your site, they will need to 
login again. To fix this, we'll add some session variables to tell us that the 
user has already logged in. If you don't understand session variables, you can 
read <a href="http://www.phpfreaks.com/tutorials/41/1.php">
this sessions tutorial</a> first. Otherwise, read on:</p>

<textarea cols="50" rows="10">&lt;?php
	//...snip...
	if($affected_rows == 1) {
		print 'validated';
		//add the user to our session variables
		$_SESSION['user_name'] = $user_name;
	}
	else {
		print 'not valid';
	}
?&gt;</textarea>

<p>And, finally, to check if they've logged in from any other page, include this:</p>

<textarea cols="50" rows="10">&lt;?php
	session_start();
	if(empty($_SESSION['user_name'])) {
             die('An error has ocurred. It may be that you have not logged in,
                  or that your session has expired.
                  Please try &lt;a href="login.php"&gt;logging in&lt;/a&gt; again 
                  or contact the 
                  &lt;a href="mailto:admin@example.com"&gt;system administrator&lt;/a&gt;');
	}
?&gt;</textarea>

<p>And now, we've just developed a very simple authentication script. This is just 
a base for further experimentation - please never install this on a production 
server. However, you are free to take my code and play with it. If you do, or if 
you have any other comments, drop me an email at <a href="mail:llimllib@f2o.org">llimllib@f2o.org</a>.
Remember, don't be afraid to 
experiment, and most of all, have fun!</p>
