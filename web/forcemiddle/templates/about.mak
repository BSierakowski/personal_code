Force Middle was founded in 2007 by three ultimate frisbee
teammates. Each of us has been playing ultimate frisbee for 5+ years on various
levels. Currently, we are all members of an open club team from Baltimore,
<a href="http://billmill.org/static/medmen/lib/exe/detail.php?id=start&cache=cache&media=medmen_team_small.jpg">Medicine Men</a>. We conceived 
this company as a project that would help to build
ultimate frisbee culture and help college teams promote themselves on a wider
stage (not to mention allow us to buy the coolest discs).<p>

We launched our website in January, 2008 with 4 discs from around the country.
We plan to continue adding new designs from other teams, so be sure to check
back frequently. <!--or <sign up> for our new disc email list.--><p>

You can contact us at 
<a href="mailto:forcemiddlediscs@gmail.com">forcemiddlediscs@gmail.com</a>.

<h2>Return Policy</h2>
<p>Unused discs may be returned for full refund of the purchase price of the disc within 30 days of purchase. The customer must pay for return shipping for the disc. Refunds will be paid by check, please allow 4 weeks for processing.
