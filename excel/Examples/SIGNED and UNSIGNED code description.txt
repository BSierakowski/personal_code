IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000
=================================================

Microsoft has introduced security settings in Word, Excel,
and PowerPoint. These security settings determine whether
or not you can run Visual Basic for Applications macros.
While a detailed list of all the security features and
what they mean to you is beyond the scope of this document,
we will cover what you need to know to run the macros
embedded within some of the documents we have provided on
the CD-ROM for your perusal and use.

Microsoft Office 2000 installs with security set to high.
This means that all macros will be disabled without warning.
By switching your security settings to Medium, you will be
warned about the macro and given the option to enable or
disable the embedded macros. By switching your security
settings to Low, embedded macros will be enabled
automatically.

Some of you won't have the option of changing the security
level because your security policy is set by a network
or security administrator in a corporation. On the CD-ROM
in the SOURCE directory are two directories called SIGNED
and UNSIGNED. Placed within the SIGNED directory are
documents that we have signed using a Verisign Class 3
certificate. If you open our signed code when your security
setting is set to High, you will be asked to trust
documents signed by us for use on your machine.

NOTE: Verisign Class 3 certificates issued for Office 2000
will expire after one year. You will be told the certificate
has expired, but you will still be able to enable macros
within the documents.
